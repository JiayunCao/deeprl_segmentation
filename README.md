# Deep RL Segmentation
Project for Berkeley Deep RL course: using deep reinforcement learning for segmentation of medical images

# Data pre-processing
For the data pre-processing script to work:
- Clone cocoapi inside the deeprl_segmentation folder, and follow the instructions to install it (usually just need to run Make
inside the PythonAPI folder)
- Download your coco dataset (for example, val2017) inside the deeprl_segmentation folder
- Download the corresponding annotations, and place them inside a folder called annotations inside the deeprl_segmentation folder
